Welcome to GNU Taler
--------------------

What is Taler?
==============

Taler is an electronic payment system providing the ability to pay
anonymously using digital cash.  Taler consists of a network protocol
definition (using a RESTful API over HTTP), a Exchange (which creates
digital coins), a Wallet (which allows customers to manage, store and
spend digital coins), and a Merchant website which allows customers to
spend their digital coins.  Naturally, each Merchant is different, but
Taler includes code examples to help Merchants integrate Taler as a
payment system.

Taler is currently developed by a worldwide group of independent free software
developers and Taler Systems SA.  Taler is free software and an official GNU
package (https://www.gnu.org/).

This is an alpha release with a few known bugs, lacking a few important
features, documentation, testing, performance tuning and an external security
audit.  However, you can run the code and it largely works fine.  This package
also only includes the Taler exchange, not the other components of the system.

Documentation about Taler can be found at https://taler.net/.
Our bug tracker is at https://bugs.taler.net/.


Joining GNU
===========

This is a GNU program, developed by the GNU Project and part of the
GNU Operating System. If you are the author of an awesome program and
want to join us in writing Free Software, please consider making it an
official GNU program and become a GNU maintainer.  You can find
instructions on how to do so at http://www.gnu.org/help/evaluation.
We are looking forward to hacking with you!
