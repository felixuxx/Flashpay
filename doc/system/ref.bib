  abstract="Pedersen designed the first scheme for generating Discrete- Log keys without any trusted dealer in 1991. As this protocol is simple and efficient, it appeared to be very attractive. For a long time, this robust algorithm has been trusted as being secure. However, in 1999, Gennaro et al. proved that one of the requirements is not guaranteed : more precisely, the property that the key is uniformly distributed in the key space. Their main objective was to repair the security flaw without sacrificing on efficiency. As a result, the protocol became secure but somehow unpractical. In particular, the ``complaint phase'', in which cheaters are thrown out, makes the scheme overly complex and difficult to deal with in practical situations. In order to avoid this phase and other drawbacks such as the initialization phase where private channels have to be created, we present a one round scheme which generates a discrete-log key with public channels only. Finally, we show how to improve the efficiency of our algorithm when the number of servers increases.",

Unfortunately, traditional MPC algorithms do not scale well to large numbers of parties. In this paper, we describe several recent MPC algorithms that are designed to handle large networks. All of these algorithms rely on recent techniques from the Byzantine agreement literature on forming and using quorums. Informally, a quorum is a small set of parties, most of which are trustworthy. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of these scalable algorithms, and we propose new ideas for improving practicality of current techniques. Finally, we conduct simulations to measure bandwidth cost for several current MPC algorithms.",

  abstract="Off-line e-cash systems are the digital analogue of regular cash. One of the main desirable properties is anonymity: spending a coin should not reveal the identity of the spender and, at the same time, users should not be able to double-spend coins without being detected. Compact e-cash systems make it possible to store a wallet of O(2                  L                ) coins using O(L{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}$\lambda$) bits, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter. They are called divisible whenever the user has the flexibility of spending an amount of 2ℓ, for some ℓ{\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}L, more efficiently than by repeatedly spending individual coins. This paper presents the first construction of divisible e-cash in the standard model (i.e., without the random oracle heuristic). The scheme allows a user to obtain a wallet of 2                  L                 coins by running a withdrawal protocol with the bank. Our construction is built on the traditional binary tree approach, where the wallet is organized in such a way that the monetary value of a coin depends on how deep the coin is in the tree.",

In this paper, we first propose a definition of security for blind signatures, with application to electronic cash. Next, we focus on a specific example which can be successfully transformed in a provably secure blind signature scheme.",

abstract="Divisible E-cash has been introduced twenty years ago but no construction is both fully secure in the standard model and efficiently scalable. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing an anonymous divisible E-cash construction with constant-time withdrawal and spending protocols. Moreover, the deposit protocol is constant-time for the merchant, whatever the spent value is. It just has to compute and store                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^l{\$}{\$}                   serial numbers when a value                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^l{\$}{\$}                   is deposited, compared to                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^n{\$}{\$}                   serial numbers whatever the spent amount (where                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^n{\$}{\$}                   is the global value of the coin) in the recent state-of-the-art paper.

abstract="Recently, several ``divisible'' untraceable off-line electronic cash schemes have been presented [8, 11, 19, 20]. This paper presents the first practical ``divisible'' untraceable1 off-line cash scheme that is ``single-term''2 in which every procedure can be executed in the order of log N, where N is the precision of divisibility, i.e., N = (the total coin value)/(minimum divisible unit value). Therefore, our ``divisible'' off-line cash scheme is more efficient and practical than the previous schemes. For example, when N = 217 (e.g., the total value is about {\$} 1000, and the minimum divisible unit is 1 cent), our scheme requires only about 1 Kbyte of data be transfered from a customer to a shop for one payment and about 20 modular exponentiations for one payment, while all previous divisible cash schemes require more than several Kbytes of transfered data and more than 200 modular exponentiations for one payment.",

TFO allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake, and saves up to one full round-trip time (RTT) compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged. However, TFO deviates from the standard TCP semantics, since the data in the SYN could be replayed to an application in some rare circumstances. Applications should not use TFO unless they can tolerate this issue, as detailed in the Applicability section.},
