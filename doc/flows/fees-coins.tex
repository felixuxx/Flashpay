\section{Fees per coin} \label{sec:fees:coin}

Payments with Taler are always made using coins.  Each coin has a specific
denomination, and an exchange will issue coins in different denominations (in
the same currency).  The fees per coin depend on the operation and the
denomination.

The primary fee to be paid is a {\bf deposit} fee that is
charged whenever a coin is fully or partially deposited
into a bank account or another wallet.

A secondary fee to be paid is a {\bf change} fee that is
charged whenever a coin partially spent and change must
be rendered.

Coins also have an {\bf expiration} date of approximately {\bf one year}.
After the expiration date, coins become worthless.  Wallets that are online
{\bf three months} {\em before} a coin expires will automatically trade any
such coins for one or more fresh coins with a later expiration date. This
process is also subject to the {\bf change} fee.
