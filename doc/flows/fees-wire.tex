\section{Fees per wire} \label{sec:fees:wire}

Wire fees apply whenever an exchange needs to initiate a wire transfer to
another bank account.  Wire fees do not apply to every individual payment to a
merchant, as merchants can choose to {\em aggregate} multiple micropayments
into one large payment on the wire.  Wire fees also do not apply to
wallet-to-wallet payments within the Taler system.

A {\bf wire} fee is applied when a merchant receives
an aggregated payment into their bank account.

A {\bf closing} fee is applied when a wallet fails to
withdraw coins and money has to be sent back to the
originating bank account.
