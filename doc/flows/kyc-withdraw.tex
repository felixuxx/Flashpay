    bank account.
    If the transfer is denied or the user fails to withdraw the
    funds for any other reason, the money is automatically returned
    after the bounce period (see Table~\ref{table:kyc:withdraw:settings}) to
    the originating bank account.}

%The limit of 200 \CURRENCY{} results from article 48-2.  Strictly limiting
%withdrawals to less than 5'000 \CURRENCY{} per month and less than 15'000
%\CURRENCY{} per year assures compliance with article 48-1c.

SMS-Identification is done by in-house software.  Withdraw limits are
hard and cannot be raised even if the customer is known.
