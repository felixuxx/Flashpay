 *
 * We also verify that the @a coin_sig is valid for this deposit
 * request, and that the @a ub_sig is a valid signature for @a

 * @param wire_deadline execution date, until which the merchant would like the exchange to settle the balance (advisory, the exchange cannot be

 * @param merchant_payto_uri the merchantâ€™s account details, in the payto://-format supported by the exchange
 * @param wire_salt salt used to hash the @a merchant_payto_uri
 * @param h_contract_terms hash of the contact of the merchant with the customer (further details are never disclosed to the exchange)
 * @param extension_details extension-specific details about the deposit relevant to the exchange
 * @param coin_pub coinâ€™s public key
 * @param denom_pub denomination key with which the coin is signed
 * @param denom_sig exchangeâ€™s unblinded signature of the coin
 * @param timestamp timestamp when the contract was finalized, must match approximately the current time of the exchange
 * @param merchant_pub the public key of the merchant (used to identify the merchant for refund requests)
 * @param refund_deadline date until which the merchant can issue a refund to the customer via the exchange (can be zero if refunds are not allowed); must not be after the @a wire_deadline
 * @param coin_sig the signature made with purpose #TALER_SIGNATURE_WALLET_COIN_DEPOSIT made by the customer with the coinâ€™s private key.
 * @param cb the callback to call when a reply for this request is available
 * @param cb_cls closure for the above callback
 * @param[out] ec if NULL is returned, set to the error code explaining why the operation failed
 * @return a handle for this request; NULL if the inputs are invalid (i.e.
