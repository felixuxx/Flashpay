COMMENT ON TABLE auditor_progress_reserve
  IS 'information as to which transactions the reserve auditor has processed in the exchange database.  Used for SELECTing the
 statements to process.  The indices include the last serial ID from the respective tables that we have processed. Thus, we need to select those table entries that are strictly larger (and process in monotonically increasing order).';
