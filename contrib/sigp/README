This directory contains bootstrap code to extract info from the
Signature Purposes database (registry) and format it in various ways.
It is a peer of ${top_srcdir}/contrib/gana/ (q.v.).

NB: New database entries MUST have field "Package: GNU Taler" if
    you want them to be visible to the Makefile in this directory.

Don't make changes to registry.rec here (it is a symlink, after all).
Instead, make them in ../gana/gnunet-signatures/ or from a separate
checkout of the GANA Git repo (commit from there, too).
