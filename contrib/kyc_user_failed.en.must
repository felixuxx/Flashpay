<!-- {{logic}} indicates the type of KYC provider
     which generated the reply; for now, only
     "kycaid" is possible. Switch on the
     {{logic}} to render results in a provider-specific
     way. (or introduce new templates per provider?) -->
<!-- TODO: figure out exactly what the
     format of 'verifications' is here
     based on KYCAID documentation and parse
     that here. -->
