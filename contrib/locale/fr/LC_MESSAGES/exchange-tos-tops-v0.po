msgid "GNU Taler is a technical system that enables cashless payments. Taler Operations AG (hereinafter **TOPS**), headquartered in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland, provides a **payment system** based on GNU Taler for users in Switzerland. TOPS is a member of VQF, a FINMA-accredited self-regulating organisation. Consequently, TOPS will therefore not be directly supervised by the Swiss financial services regulation authority FINMA, but operates a financial service  in accordance with Art. 6 para. 2 Banking Ordinance without commercial banking status (non-bank) and therefore without customer deposit protection."

Users are free to choose  their Taler wallet application. Beneficiaries are also free to choose their Taler wallet application or Taler backend. Various solutions are provided by various providers.

In order to let the wallet withdraw the desired amount of money, users select from within the Taler wallet the payment service provider operated by TOPS and wire this amount of money to the bank account of the payment service provider. TOPS may introduce further withdrawal options or cease to offer existing mechanisms. Any transaction fees or other fees associated with wiring or with withdrawals shall be borne by the users.

When users make payments, the corresponding amount of e-money is debited directly from the Taler wallet. At least the transaction amount must be available in the Taler wallet's balance. Users consent to all payments made with the Taler wallet from their digital end device, even if these payments were made without their agreement. Anyone who redeems a token in the Taler wallet has used its represented value of the credit for payment."
